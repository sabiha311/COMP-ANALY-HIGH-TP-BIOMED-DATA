# RNA to DNA Transcription & Nucleotide Frequency Analysis

# Description
This project analyzes RNA sequences by:
1. Reverse transcribing RNA to DNA.
2. Computing dinucleotide & trinucleotide frequencies.
3. Identifying significant (3X) frequency differences.

# Files Included
- quiz2.py (or RNA_Analysis.py) → Main Python script.
- Dinucleotide_Frequencies.csv → Computed dinucleotide frequencies.
- Trinucleotide_Frequencies.csv → Computed trinucleotide frequencies.
- Significant_Dinucleotide_Differences.csv → Dinucleotides with 3x differences.
- Significant_Trinucleotide_Differences.csv → Trinucleotides with 3x differences.

# How to Run the Code
1. Clone the repository:
2.  Navigate to the folder:
3.  Run the Python script:
4.  The output CSV files will be generated.
